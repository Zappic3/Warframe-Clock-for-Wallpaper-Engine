## Function
The clock uses your local your local computer time, while the Baro Ki'teer timer loads Baros arrival time and planet from the Warframstatus Void Trader API.
(https://api.warframestat.us/pc/voidTrader)

Because of this, the Baro Ki'teer Timer requires a internet connection. For more convinience, the loaded data is locally stored. In the end, the wallpaper only requires every 12 - 14 days a internet connection. When required data cant be loaded, this warning will be displayed:

## Customization
When you use this projekt with Wallpaper Engine, you can customize it via the Wallpaper Engine menu.
Customizing the Wallpaper settings is probably required, because this wallpaper neither scales nor positions itself automatically. 
Even the Baro Ki'teer Timer can be hidden, if you dont like it.

## Disclaimer
This is my first JS project, so the code is pretty janky. Especially the networking.
